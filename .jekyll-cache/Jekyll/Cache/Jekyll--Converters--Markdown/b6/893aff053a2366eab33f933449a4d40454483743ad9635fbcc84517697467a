I"‡<p>Bitcamp is an exploratory hackathon experience at the University of Maryland. I founded Bitcamp with some friends from Startup Shell and Terrapin Hackers. We wanted to create a hackathon experience that encouraged exploration into new technologies. From there, I led the design, brand, and marketing efforts. Bitcamp has impacted over 2,500 participants and raised over $350,000 in sponsorship in its two years of existence.</p>
