I"I<p>Startup Shell is a nonprofit student-run incubator and coworking space at the University of Maryland. I served as Executive Director at Startup Shell for over two years. During that time, we have incubated over 150 students and 50 ventures while radically shifting the startup culture at University of Maryland. I also led most design efforts ranging from web design and flyers to interior design and video production.</p>
