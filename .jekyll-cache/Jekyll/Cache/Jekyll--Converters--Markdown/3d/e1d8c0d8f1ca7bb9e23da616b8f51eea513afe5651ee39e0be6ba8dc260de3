I"k<p>MIDI Markup is a music markup language and synthesizer for visually impaired composers. After listening to talks at SXGood about accessibility and technology, we decided to focus our efforts on helping blind, and visually-impaired people in music. Our product is more accessible than other music markup languages and helps users navigate interfaces with audio queues.</p>

<p>I hacked on this project with <a href="https://twitter.com/stefcohen3">Stef Cohen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nikolazaris">Niko Lazaris</a> at <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/conference/sxsw-hackathon/">SXSW Music Hackathon</a>.</p>
