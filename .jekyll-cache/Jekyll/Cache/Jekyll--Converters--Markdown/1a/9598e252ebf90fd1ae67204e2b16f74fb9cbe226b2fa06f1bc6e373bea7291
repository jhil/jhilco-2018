<p>It’s healthy to take time to yourself to calm down. I keep a list of a few topics that get me in that zone, helping me quickly switch from the intense work grind to relaxing or getting ready for sleep.</p>

<p>I call this my Arsenal of Calm. 😌</p>

<p>Here are some of the search terms that I plug into YouTube when selecting relaxation videos. I encourage you to assemble an arsenal of your own.</p>

<h2 id="woodworking-">Woodworking 🛠</h2>

<p>The steady motions and earthy noises that go into woodworking are quite soothing. And you might even learn a new craft while doing it!</p>

<h2 id="massage-">Massage 👐</h2>

<p>I’ve been watching instructional massage videos for a few years now. Not only is it perfect backdrop for chillaxing, but you can pick up interesting tips to try out yourself with self-massage.</p>

<h2 id="butchery-">Butchery 🍖</h2>

<p>This might surprise you… But I swear, the smooth strokes of a skilled knife are absolutely hypnotizing.</p>

<h2 id="glass-blowing-">Glass Blowing 🔥</h2>

<p>Another artsy trade on the list! Watching gooey hot silicon magic is the best.</p>

<p>A few tips for building your arsenal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Try to select long videos. Finding the next video to watch actually causes stress, so I’m looking for 8+ minute clips. Or make a playlist!</li>
  <li>A lot of these interests originated from exploring the r/ArtisanVideos subreddit. There’s some calming gold in there — check it out!</li>
  <li>Music always helps, too! I’ve got my go-to “Calm Down” Spotify playlist.</li>
  <li>Don’t tell your friends about your strange calming habits. They will tease you. Definitely don’t write a Medium post about it. They’ll see it.</li>
</ul>
