I"8<p>Interact is a community of technologists dedicated to social progress. Mackenzie Burnett, Maran Nelson, and Gwen Brinsmead approached me and Amritha Jayanti to rebrand the organization.</p>

<p>We explored dozens of design directions before landing on the final mark. It represents two central themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Interact fellows display intentional impact. The line following the wordmark represents that participants are able to see whatâ€™s next.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The value that fellows get from Interact comes after the annual retreat when they can lean on the community for support and growth.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I made supplemental animations and web styles that inspired the final website, which was eventually designed and built by Gwen, Evan Pun, and Dan Schlosser.</p>
